			<p>	Hello! I believe that you are always a student, never a master. We are always learning new things, life is just a big learning experience. My dream is to travel to Tokyo, immerse myself into that culture. I enjoy watching all the new Marvel movies that are coming out, but I am not crazy over DC.</p>
			<p>	I currently work as a pharmacy technian, but I want to be have a career as a developer. I've been in my current position for 5 years, my co-workers and boss have become a family to me. We could't get through the day without eachothers support. As Stannis Baratheon said, "You go forward, only forward."</p>
